[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adrianObel/redux-create-actions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adrianObel/redux-create-actions)  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-0.1.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/adrianObel/redux-create-actions) [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com)

`redux-create-actions` is a library that helps construct FSA compliant action creators and massively decreasing the amount of boilerplate necessary to generate constants and action creators.

## Getting started
### install
```bash
$ npm install --save redux-create-actions
```
or
```bash
$ yarn add redux-create-actions
```

## Usage
Suppose we need to generate action creators and constants to filter loaded todos and also fetch remote todos

```js
import { module, createAction, createAsyncAction } from 'redux-create-actions'

const {
  actions,
  constants
} = module('@todos', {
  filterTodos: createAction('FILTER_TODOS'),
  fetchTodos: createAsyncAction('FETCH_TODOS')
})
```

The `module` block noted in the example above would return an object with a shape of
```js
{
  constants: {
    'FILTER_TODOS': '@todos/FILTER_TODOS',
    'FETCH_TODOS': '@todos/FETCH_TODOS',
    'FETCH_TODOS_START': '@todos/FETCH_TODOS_START',
    'FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS': '@todos/FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS',
    'FETCH_TODOS_FAILURE': '@todos/FETCH_TODOS_FAILURE'
  },
  actions: {
    filterTodos: Fn,
    fetchTodos: Fn
      - fetchTodos.start: Fn
      - fetchTodos.success: Fn
      - fetchTodos.failure: Fn
  }
}
```

## Documentation
### createAction
```js
createAction(actionType: string) -> ActionCreator
```

Utility function for generating action creators
```js
ActionCreator = (payload, meta) -> { type, payload, meta }
```

### createAsyncAction
```js
createAsyncAction(actionType: string) -> AsyncActionCreator
```

Utility function for generating async action creators. This will output a function (action creator) with `start`, `success`, and `failure` invokable properties for ease of use.

```js
AsyncActionCreator = ActionCreator
AsyncActionCreator.start = ActionCreator
AsyncActionCreator.success = ActionCreator
AsyncActionCreator.failure = ActionCreator

```

### module
```js
module(namespace: string, actions: Object) -> { constants, actions }
```

`namespace` optional string to scope actions generated by module.
`actions` object of action creators

```js
{
  filterTodos: createAction('FILTER_TODOS'),
  fetchTodos: createAsyncAction('FETCH_TODOS')
}
```

## Motivation
Redux brought along many great things to the world of software development, unfortunately that came with a bit of extra boilerplate. While the boilerplate is manageable repeating the same code time and time again grows tiresome, especially when it comes to writing constants and action creators.

Take a usual file that exports constants and action creators for both sync and async actions.

```js
const LOAD_POSTS = '@home/LOAD_POSTS'
const LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST = {
  START: '@home/LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST_START',
  SUCCESS: '@home/LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST_SUCCESS',
  FAILURE: '@home/LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST_FAILURE'
}

export const constants = {
  LOAD_POSTS,
  LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST
}

const loadPosts = ({ payload }) => ({ type: LOAD_POSTS, payload })
const loadPostsRequest = {
  start: ({ payload }) => ({ type: LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST.START, payload }),
  success: ({ payload }) => ({ type: LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST.SUCCESS, payload }),
  failure: ({ payload }) => ({ type: LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST.FAILURE, payload })
}

export const actions {
  loadPosts,
  loadPostsRequest
}
```

Writing action creators and constants like this quickly becomes very tedious work, and that's where `redux-create-actions` comes in. The previous module would condense down to
```js
import { module, createAsyncAction } from 'redux-create-actions'

const {
  constants,
  actions
} = module('home', {
  loadPosts: createAsyncAction('LOAD_POSTS')
})
```
